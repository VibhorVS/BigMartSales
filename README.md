Introduction
Sales prediction is a crucial task for businesses to optimize inventory and resources. This repository provides a basic template for building a sales prediction model using XGBoost. The dataset used here contains information about items, outlets, and their corresponding sales.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

Python 3.6+
Required Python packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost
You can install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-prediction.git
Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

bash
Copy code
cd sales-prediction
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python sales_prediction.py
This script will load the dataset, preprocess it, train the XGBoost regressor, and evaluate the model.

Data Preprocessing
The dataset (Train.csv) is loaded and preprocessed in the following steps:

Missing values in the 'Item_Weight' column are filled with the mean value.
Missing values in the 'Outlet_Size' column are filled with the mode value based on the 'Outlet_Type'.
Data visualization using seaborn to understand the distributions and relationships between features.
Encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
Model Training
The XGBoost regressor is used to train the sales prediction model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the R-squared (RÂ²) metric on both the training and testing datasets to assess its performance.
